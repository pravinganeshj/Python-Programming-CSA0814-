code:
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]

if not numbers:
    least_significant, most_significant = None, None
else:
    # Find the smallest and largest elements using min and max functions
    least_significant = min(numbers)
    most_significant = max(numbers)

print(f"Least significant element: {least_significant}")
print(f"Most significant element: {most_significant}")

output:
least significant: 1
most significant: 9
