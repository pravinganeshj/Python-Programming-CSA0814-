# Original list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Step 1: Square all the elements
squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)

# Step 2: Filter out the squares that are even numbers
even_squares = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, squared_numbers)

# Convert the filter object to a list and print the result
result = list(even_squares)
print(result)

output:
[4, 16]
