codes:
arr=[4,5,6,7,4,5,9,10,4]
for i in range(len(arr)):
    count=1
  if arr[i]!=-1:
     for j in range(i+1,len(arr)):
         if arr[i]==arr[j]:
            count+=1
            arr[j]=-1
     if count>1:
         print("element:",arr[i])
         print("occurrance:",count)

  
output:
element: 4
  occurrance: 3
  element: 5
  occurrance: 2
